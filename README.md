# hello-world

Hello there,

My name is Miri and I'm a motivated Computer Science (BSc.) student in the Academic College of Tel-Aviv Yaffo, aspiring to become a highly skilled professional.

After a few years in the High-Tech industry, in Content and Product Management roles, I decided to get a CS education, in order to bring a more knowledgeable standpoint to the technological discussions and decision making process.
While in my studies, I came to realize that, hey, I enjoy programming! I've discovered that I gain fulfillment from writing high quality code and developing my programming abilities.

I am currently half way through completing my degree. In the course of my studies so far, I got to program in C, C++ and Python. I have also gained familiarity with some basic HTML, CSS and SQL, through online resources and aspects in my previous working experience.

My main goal right now is to learn as much as possible from hands-on experience, colleagues and mentors, and extend my knowledge of different platforms, tools, programming languages and industry best-practices. I want to be able to produce clean, beatiful, efficient and reliable code, and I am more than willing to sweat for it!

Cheers,
Miri
